# CSC 131 - Computational Thinking
## Lab 3

Write a Python program with the code for **at least TWO** of the following three functions: 

 * A recursive function called `stutter` that returns a string with each character in its argument repeated. For example, if the string passed to stutter is "abc", stutter will return the string "aabbcc". 
 * A recursive function called `toNumber` that returns the integer sum of all digit characters in a string. For example, the result of `toNumber("ab3c7d1")` would be `11`. Assume that `toNumber` returns `0` when called on an empty string. (Hint: you may use the method `isdigit()` to check whether or not a character is a digit.)
 * A recursive function `findAverage` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the average of the values in the list. For example, `findAverage([3, 4, 5])` should return the value `4.0` and `findAverage([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])` should return the value `5.5`.

After completing the two functions you selected, add a main function to test your code. Make sure that `main()` is called when your program is run.

Name your file `lab3.py`. Make sure to include your name and the name of your TRACE folder at the top of the file in a docstring. When you are done, demonstrate your code to the instructor and upload an electronic copy of your solution to your CSC131 upload folder in a folder named `LABS\lab3`.
