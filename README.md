### Reference
 * **Learn X in Y Minutes** - Excellent crash courses in various computer languages.
     * [Learn Python in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)
     * [Learn C++ in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/)
 * **[LearnPython.org](https://learnpython.org/)** - **Interactive python tutorial**. A good way to introduce yourself to python if you prefer hands-on learning.
 * **[Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)**
     * [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) - Good starting point / place to refresh broader topics
     * [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) - Explains functionality of built-in objects and functions
     * [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) - Explains the base rules of Python and its overall functionality. You probably won't need this one as often, but it's good to keep it in mind.
 * **C++ tutorials and reference**
     * [LearnCpp.com's In-Depth C++ Tutorial](https://www.learncpp.com/) - In my experience, this is the best, most comprehensive learning resource for C++ available online - and it's free!
     * [General C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) - Not terribly easy to read, but it is a pretty comprehensive source of detailed C++ information.
     * [C++ Standard Library Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) - Somewhat analogous to Python's library reference mentioned above. Contains information about objects and functions included in the various C++ standard header files.
