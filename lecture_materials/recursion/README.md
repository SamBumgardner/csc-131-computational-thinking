# CSC 131 - Computational Thinking
## Recursion Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [Recursion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gz5XmiwFFqwlxB0cpAAk20wK1xwUlvszyWzVkeXs5MM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [run_forever.py](./run_forever.py) - An excellent example of a recursive function that is NOT useful.
 * [recursive_functions.py](./recursive_functions.py) - A collection of short recursive functions. Good as a quick reference.
 * [permutations.py](./permutations.py) - A more involved example of recursion.

### External Reference
 * [Recursion lecture materials](.) - A collection of lecture materials about the subject of recursion for our CSC 131 class.
 * [University of Utah - Recursion Reading](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/recursion.html) - I found this reading during some basic googling, and found it to be a nice, practical look at how to work with and think about recursion.
 * [4-year old MIT Reading on Recursion](http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/classes/10-recursion/) - This one won't be a particularly fast read, but I like the depth with which it covers the subject. I especially like its diagram of the call stack that shows up pretty early in the reading.
 * [Wikipedia's article on Stack Overflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow) - This is definitely the most common error you'll run into when playing around with recursion. This is a nice overview of the error, and it links to several other pages of interesting recursion-related information.
