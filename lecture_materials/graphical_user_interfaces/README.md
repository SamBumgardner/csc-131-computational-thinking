## Graphical User Interfaces Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [Graphical User Interfaces](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h0NhRZsmWYolA0lxoYG2VO82usMPRYjlyb_4jvYe7Sk/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
There are a lot of useful examples for this section of content. I've done my best to arrange the directory structure in a logical way that makes it easy to find the examples that are useful to you. 

A description of an example file's purpose can be added to this section upon request, just let me know what needs clarifying.

### External Reference
 * [Python Tkinter Documentation](https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-index.htm#class-reference) - Tkinter documentation was surprisingly difficult to track down. This set of documentation hasn't been updated in a while, but it provides a pretty comprehensive overview of what all of the Tkinter widgets can do.
