### Lecture Slides
 * [Design With Classes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GUNXgSEywlsX59YaypG0f5Rduj9LO3OAmnAD7mNsLlY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [student.py](./student.py) - Example of a basic class, the first we discuss during the lecture.
 * [circle.py](./circle.py) - Class representing a circle. During lecture, we went through the process of building this class ourselves.
     * [circleDemo.py](./circleDemo.py) - Example program that uses the Circle class.
 * [rational.py](./rational.py) - Class representing a rational number. This is a good reference when defining math and comparison behaviors in a class.
     * [rationalTest.py](./rationalTest.py) - Example program that uses the Rational class.
 * [craps.py](./craps.py) - Defines the `Player` class, which uses two `Die` objects (defined in the `die.py` file included below) to play a simple dice game. This is an excellent reference for how different classes can work together.
     * [die.py](./die.py) - Class representing a six-sided die. Can be "rolled" to get random results.
