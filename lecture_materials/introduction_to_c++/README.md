# CSC 131 - Computational Thinking
## Introduction to C++ Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [C++ Basic Constructs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j9Ik_DNFQWR4h15vtWa8-tFjRHB8gZPZ8LRyI9Ihjkk/edit?usp=sharing)

### C++ Example Programs
Examples will be added as we go over them in class, and I expect each sub-section of C++ content will end up getting its own little folder of programs. A master list of uploaded examples will be maintained here.

### External Reference
 * [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) - A truly excellent resource for learning C++. I tend to prefer its approach to learning the language - focusing on topics like header files and multi-file programs early is a particularly appealing to me. It's not required reading, but consider this resource an excellent supplement to everything our in-class lecture focuses on.
 * [General C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) - Not terribly easy to read, but it is a pretty comprehensive source of detailed C++ information.
 * [C++ Standard Library Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) - Contains information about objects and functions included in the various C++ standard libraries
