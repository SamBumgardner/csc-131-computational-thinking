# CSC 131 - Computational Thinking
## Final Exam Study Guide
### General Information
This exam will allow up to **2** front & back standard-size pages of prepared notes. Please take advantage of all space allotted to you - preparation makes tests 1000000% easier.

### List of Topics

The test will be over the information listed below. Information on all topics should be available in the class lecture slides to some extent. However, there have been many examples, questions, and discussions in class that are not completely captured by the raw presentations. **Any information discussed during class lecture may appear on the test**.

I recommend reviewing notes, **writing practice programs**, studying with other students, reviewing past homework / lab programs, reading the book, or looking up information online in addition to looking over presentation slides to prepare for this test.

If you have a solid foundation of knowledge (with well-prepared pages of notes) and plenty of practice, you should understand these topics on both a theoretical and practical level. If you're armed with that understanding, this test should be no trouble whatsoever.

The topics that may be covered in the test are as follows:
 * Basic Constructs
     * What is the purpose of a compiler?
     * Comment syntax 
         * `//` for single line
         * `/* ... */` for multi-line
     * Basic namespace rules
         * How do we use keywords from standard libraries (like `cout` or `endl`) if we don't put `using namespace std` in a program?
     * Displaying output with `cout`
     * "Identifier" (variable and function) name rules
         * Recognize if an identifier is illegal
     * Knowledge of basic types. For each type mentioned in the slides, know the following:
         * Type name
         * Purpose / use case for the type. When is it appropriate to use?
     * Defining and initializing variables - be familiar with all methods in slides.
     * C++ operators
         * Addition: \+
         * Subtraction: \-
         * Multiplication: \*
         * Division: /
         * Modulo: %
         * Increment: ++
         * Decrement: --
         * Assignment: =
         * Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=
 * Control Statements - more details coming soon
 * Pointers - more details coming soon
