## Higher Order Functions Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [Higher Order Functions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_OI7ILhKn_vWMr_gu5FMt9xvN1bK_uR1WEHV2j-zGPs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [first_factor.py](./first_factor.py) - Basic example of `map()` in action.
 * [jump_table.py](./jump_table.py) - Example of a jump table. Involves assigning functions to variables.

### External Reference
 * [lambda, map and filter in Python](https://medium.com/@happymishra66/lambda-map-and-filter-in-python-4935f248593) - A straightforward discussion of lambda expressions and a few higher-order functions with clean, simple examples to back it up. If these concepts aren't clicking right away, try giving this a read.
 * [Python's official tutorial about list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) - Introduces list comprehensions with a lot of examples of increasing complexity. It's a good idea to read over this to check that the examples fit with your understanding of list comprehensions.
 * [Python's official tutorial about anonymous functions (lambda expressions)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) - Doesn't really go in-depth on what a lambda expression is, but provides a couple of mildly interesting examples.
 * [Overusing lambda expressions in Python](https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/) - This is an interesting article I ran across while prepping this week of content. I think it's a bit quick to condemn lambdas in some cases, but overall the point of the article is a valid one. Lambda expressions are both inherently less easily documented and more compact than ordinary functions, so the decision to use them in code shouldn't be one made lightly. Now, that said, they are very good for some situations. Also, like them or not, it's important to learn about them so they don't feel mysterious or magical.
