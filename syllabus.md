### Recommended Textbooks
 1. *Fundamentals of Python: First Programs. By: Kenneth A. Lambert. ISBN-13: 978-1111822705.*

Students may purchase an ebook or eChapters from the publisher’s web site at (http://www.cengagebrain.com/). In addition, there are web sites such as www.findbookprices.com that you may use to buy the book online for a discounted price.

 2. *Starting out with C++ from Control Structures through Objects. By: Tony Gaddis. 9th edition  
      is preferred.*

### Course Description
Solving problems using computation and implementing solutions in the Python and C++ high-level programming languages. Introduction to problem analysis and solution design. Topics will include: problem solving techniques; objects and classes; graphical user interfaces; event handling; Introduction to C++ programming. 

### Absence Policy
Students are expected to attend class. If you will miss class or need to leave class early, please let the instructor know ahead of time. Students are responsible for everything explained, announced, or distributed during the lectures and the labs. If you miss any returned work (e.g., exams and homework assignments) due to absence, it is your responsibility to come to my office and get that work from me. I hold no responsibility for keeping any work that you do not claim within one week from the day that work is returned to class.

### Examinations
There will be two hourly exams and a final for this course. The dates for the exams are given in the approximate schedule below. Make up exams will be given only in case of valid and justified reasons such as illness. If you must miss an exam, you need to make prior arrangements with the instructor. Make up exams can be completely different in context and level of difficulty from exams taken on time. 

### Grading Procedure
A student's grade in this course is determined from her/his performance on the scheduled examinations, homework programming assignments, and laboratory assignments. In order to receive a passing grade for the course, a student must receive a passing average on the examinations and a passing average on the homework and laboratory assignments. 

### Late Homework
There will be approximately between 5 to 8 homework assignments in this course. Homework assignments are always due at the beginning of class on due dates. Homework that is late will be penalized as follows: 1 day late 10% penalty; 2 days late 20% penalty; after 2 days no credit will be given for a late assignment. A weekend counts as two days even if the work is turned in on Saturday. Homework that is habitually late will not be accepted. 

### Lab Policy
The lab activity will be posted on the course web site by 5:00 pm on Mondays. When possible, they will be posted before the weekend. Students are required to work on the lab activity before arriving to the lab and they need to arrive prepared. This means that students need to study the course material needed before the lab meets. Students will be required to finish the activity before leaving the lab. Your lab grade will be based on your ability to finish the lab activity before the end of the lab time and on how prepared you arrive to the lab.

### Extra Credit
I reserve the right to offer additional assignments as opportunities to earn extra credit throughout the semester. In the event that an extra credit assignment is offered, the details of the particular assignment and extra credit will be uploaded to the course website.

### Grading Distribution
 * First Midterm Exam: **18%**
 * Second Midterm Exam: **18%**
 * Final Exam: **19%**
 * Homework Assignments: **30%**
 * Laboratory Assignments: **15%**

### Grading Scale
The following letter grades will be determined as follows: 
 * 90% ≤ A
 * 80% ≤ B < 90% 
 * 70% ≤ C < 80%
 * 60% ≤ D < 70%
 * F < 60%

### University Policies
#### Academic Integrity
Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing educated persons who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university’s student honor code, [Student Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures](http://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm) and also available at the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library. Any student participating in any form of academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions as described in this policy.

#### Nondiscrimination
Missouri State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution, and maintains a grievance procedure available to any person who believes he or she has been discriminated against. At all times, it is your right to address inquiries or concerns about possible discrimination to the Office for Equity and Compliance, Park Central Office Building, 117 Park Central Square, Suite 111, (417) 836-4252. Other types of concerns (i.e., concerns of an academic nature) should be discussed directly with your instructor and can also be brought to the attention of your instructor’s Department Head. Please visit the OED website at www.missouristate.edu/equity/.   

#### Disability Accommodation
To request academic accommodations for a disability, contact the Director of the Disability Resource Center, Plaster Student Union, Suite 405, (417) 836-4192 or (417) 836-6792 (TTY), www.missouristate.edu/disability. Students are required to provide documentation of disability to the Disability Resource Center prior to receiving accommodations. The Disability Resource Center refers some types of accommodation requests to the Learning Diagnostic Clinic, which also provides diagnostic testing for learning and psychological disabilities. For information about testing, contact the Director of the Learning Diagnostic Clinic, (417) 836-4787, http://psychology.missouristate.edu/ldc.

#### Computer Use
The Missouri State University Disciplinary Code prohibits students from unauthorized access or use of University computers, computer systems, or networks. The Computer Science Department feels that any student who uses any ID or password other than that which has been officially assigned to him or her, or who accesses unauthorized files, is in violation of the Disciplinary Code. Any student found guilty of this violation may have all access rights to University computers removed immediately and continue to have their access rights removed for the following semester. A repeat offense may cause permanent revocation of all access rights. The University may take disciplinary action in addition to those mentioned above.

#### Cell Phones
As a member of the learning community, each student has a responsibility to other students who are members of the community.  When cell phones or pagers ring and students respond in class or leave class to respond, it disrupts the class. Therefore, the Office of the Provost prohibits the use by students of cell phones, pagers, PDAs, or similar communication devices during scheduled classes. All such devices must be turned off or put in a silent (vibrate) mode and ordinarily should not be taken out during class. Given the fact that these same communication devices are an integral part of the University’s emergency notification system, an exception to this policy would occur when numerous devices activate simultaneously. When this occurs, students may consult their devices to determine if a university emergency exists. If that is not the case, the devices should be immediately returned to silent mode and put away. Other exceptions to this policy may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. Sanctions for violation of this policy are determined by the instructor and may include dismissal from the class – see Class Disruption (http://www.missouristate.edu/registrar/catalog/classdis.html). 

#### Emergency Response
At the first class meeting, students should become familiar with a basic emergency response plan through a dialogue with the instructor that includes a review and awareness of exits specific to the classroom and the location of evacuation centers for the building. All instructors are provided this information specific to their classroom and/or lab assignments in an e-mail prior to the beginning of the fall semester from the Office of the Provost and Safety and Transportation. Students with disabilities impacting mobility should discuss the approved accommodations for emergency situations and additional options when applicable with the instructor. For more information go to http://www.missouristate.edu/safetran/51597.htm and http://www.missouristate.edu/safetran/erp.htm.

#### Dropping a Class
It is your responsibility to understand the University’s procedure for dropping a class. If you stop attending this class but do not follow proper procedure for dropping the class, you will receive a failing grade and will also be financially obligated to pay for the class. For information about dropping a class or withdrawing from the university, contact the Office of the Registrar at 836-5520. 

#### Audio and Video Recording Course Activity
Audio or video recording of any course activity is prohibited except in rare circumstances and with prior arrangements with the instructor. Distribution or sale of recordings of any course materials is prohibited without the written permission of the instructor and other students who are recorded. Distribution without permission is a violation of copyright law and the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (Sections 4.6, 4.8, 4.9). 

**NOTE:** Posting any course materials online is prohibited.  

#### Religious Accommodation
The University may provide a reasonable accommodation based on a person’s sincerely held religious belief. In making this determination, the University reviews a variety of factors, including whether the accommodation would create an undue hardship. The accommodation request imposes responsibilities and obligations on both the individual requesting the accommodation and the University. Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their sincerely held religious belief shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation Form to the instructor by the end of the third week of a full semester course or the end of the second week of a half semester course.
